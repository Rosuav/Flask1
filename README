Rewrite of Rosuav's 1 in Python, using Flask.

This is an "excuse plot" for my learning Flask, and doubles as a simple
means of figuring out how long it took me to learn, starting about when
this README was created. If any of the code is actually of use to any
other person in this entire universe, I will be (a) highly impressed,
and (b) highly amused. But hey. If you want it, let me know, I'll almost
certainly say yes.

Six and a half active hours later, all inside one 24-hour period, the job
is done. This is now the primary codebase for Rosuav's 1, and is complete
but for a file of authentication details (database connection string etc)
which stays out of git (for obvious reasons!). Adding in time documenting
all of this, and I'd say Flask took me seven hours to learn. Not bad. I'd
say that means Flask is fairly compact, at least to the extent of a basic
interactive web site. (This is, admittedly, one of the simplest sites you
could write.) Note that, due to Gideon's restrictions, this code has been
written for Python 2; for future work, I would prefer to use Python 3, as
long as there's at least a 3.3 available - preferably 3.5 for the sake of
PEP 461, but 3.5 hasn't been released yet, as of 20140522 - so this code,
simple as it is, probably won't be reused anywhere, ever. Still, it's all
been worth the learning. Build one to throw away, they say.
